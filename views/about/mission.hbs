    <p>
      The policies below are applicable to the website located at
      www.bapfoundation.org and any other websites under the control of the
      Bapatla Foundation (the “Website”), however the Website is accessed and/or
      used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices, or otherwise, and
      other interactive features, applications (including mobile applications),
      or downloads that are operated by the Bapatla Foundation (“we” and “us”)
      that are made available by us. Please be advised that the practices
      described in this Privacy Policy apply only to information gathered online
      at our Website. They do not apply to information that you may submit to us
      offline or to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to
      which we may link.
    </p>

    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>

    <p>As a general matter, you can browse the Website without submitting your
      personal information to us. However, there are a number of circumstances
      in which you may need to provide us with your personal information. The
      following lists the most common ways in which we collect your personal
      information.

      media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr,
      YouTube, or Pinterest, or when you use your social media account or
      credentials to log in to the Website, we may also collect the personal
      information that you make available to us on that page or through that
      account, including your account ID or “handle.”</p>
    <p>In addition, when you interact with the Website, our servers may keep an

        device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other
        transactional information;</li>
      <li>We automatically log certain usage information about your use of the
        Website. This information includes a reading history of the pages you
        view. We use this information to provide you with a more customized
        experience on the Website;</li>
      <li>We collect and store additional “traffic data” such as time of access,
        date of access, software crash reports, session identification number,

      <li>We collect and store your search terms and search results.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also collect and store certain other information regarding our users’
      use of the Website so that third parties may provide us with reports and
      analysis regarding usage and browsing patterns of the Website.
    </p>

      information collected offline by the Foundation and information received
      from third parties—including information that currently exists in our

    <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>

    <p>The Bapatla Foundation adheres to the highest standards of ethical
      practices in all our operations and is dedicated to protecting the privacy
      of all visitors to our Website.
      <strong>Except as disclosed below, we don’t sell, barter, give away, rent,
        or permit anyone outside the Bapatla Foundation to use or access your
        personal information and in all cases we only share your personal
        information where it is in the legitimate interest of furthering the
        philanthropic aims of the Bapatla Foundation.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We occasionally use independent contractors and third-party agents,
      affiliates, and partners to perform functions such as marketing,
      analytics, providing customer service, etc., on our behalf. These entities
      have access to the personal information needed to perform their functions
      and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and
      security of any personal information collected from the Website. They are
      restricted from using, selling, distributing, or altering this data in any
      way other than to provide the requested services to the Bapatla
      Foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also occasionally share your personal information with our
      organizational and funding partners, grantees, or co-sponsors of our
      programs, activities, initiatives, and events from time to time. We
      endeavor to share your personal information only with partners, grantees,
      and co-sponsors who will respect your personal information. Although our
      treatment of your personal information is governed by this Privacy Policy,
      our partner or co-sponsor’s treatment of your personal information will be
      governed by the partner or co-sponsor’s privacy policy. You may withdraw
      your consent to our sharing of your personal information with partners and
      co-sponsors at any time by following the opt-out process described below.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also use or disclose your personal information if required to do so
      by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a)
      conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the
      Website; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Website, or
      our users; and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the
      personal safety of us, our affiliates, our agents, or the users of the
      Website or the public.

    <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>

    <p>
      Like many websites, we use “cookies,” which are small text files that are
      stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages
      that record your preferences. We use cookies to track use of our Websites
      and online services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve
      the Websites, and make it easier and/or relevant for your use. This
      Website is functional without the retention of cookies. You have the
      ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
      accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser
      setting to decline cookies. For more information on cookies and how to
      disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive
      Advertising Bureau at
      <a

        target="_blank"
        title="All About Cookies"
      >www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like some websites, we may use web beacons or flash cookies. A web beacon
      or flash cookie (also known as an “action tag” “tracer tag,” or
      “single-pixel GIF”) is an invisible graphic on a web page or e-mail
      newsletter that is programmed to collect non-personally identifiable
      information about your use of a given website or newsletter, e.g., whether
      you opened the e-mail. Like cookies, web beacons allow the Bapatla
      Foundation and its technology providers to summarize overall usage
      patterns for our analysis and provide personalized services to you. We do
      not share or provide personally identifiable information we may collect
      through such web beacons, such as names or e-mail addresses, without your
      express permission.
    </p>
    <p>The Bapatla Foundation strives to protect the transmission and storage of
      any information submitted by visitors to the Website. But no transmission
      and storage of data is completely secure, and submissions are at your sole
      risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Website may contain links to sites operated by third parties. Please
      be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy do not
      apply to information gathered through these other websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please remember that any information you share in public areas, such as
      message boards or feedback sections, becomes public, and therefore this
      Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you choose to make
      public. Please be careful about what you disclose, and do not post any
      personal information that you expect to keep private.
    </p>

      <li>A restriction of processing of your personal information;</li>

      <li>Objection to processing of your personal information based on the
        Bapatla Foundation’s legitimate interest (or those of a third party) to

        causes you to object to such processing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We hold your information and use it as described in this Privacy Policy
      and will use reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information
      is only transferred to third parties who also maintain at least the

      pursuing these aims is not in conflict with your rights. This provides our
      lawful basis to use your personal information, within the limitations set
      forth herein.</p>
    <p>The Website is published in the United States and is subject to laws of
      the United States. If you are located in a country outside the United

    <p>We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of this Privacy Policy
      from time to time without notice. Your continued use of our Website
      following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you
      accept those changes.</p>
